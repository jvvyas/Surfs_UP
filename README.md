## Resources:

**Software & Data Source**: Python, Jupyter Notebook , SQLite & PostgreSQl Database Flask to design application 


## Overview of the Statistical Analysis
An investor wants to learn more about the weather before committing to build a Surf and Ice Cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. The investor's main concern is the precipitation forcing the shop to close too frequently. A data set is provided to help with the analysis of weather patterns on the  Oahu island. After completing the additional analysis another request came in for further investigation. So, an additional analysis was requested specifically for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if the Surf & Ice Cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:

- The Average (mean) temperture for the island varies only by 3 degrees
 
- The Minimum temperture between June and December has a variability of 8 degrees
 
- The Maximum temperture between June and December has a variabliity of only 2 degrees
